The ZCom compiler is based on P6 and is considered PUBLIC DOMAIN.
It is given with NO WARRANTY. I don't guarantee that it's tested or that it works correctly.
Changes to the P6 code made by myself (Zak Fenton) will be made available under these same conditions at: https://github.com/ZYSF/ZCom/
The original sources of P6 were taken from the Download Page at: http://wirth-dijkstra-langs.org/
The original site has additional information such as rationale and history, but the legal information is copied here for clarity.
Links to the other pages can be found on the original site.
The legal information underneath (also available in the original P6 downloadables) was taken verbatim from: http://wirth-dijkstra-langs.org/waiver.html

 Waiver and Disclaimer

No license, no copyright, and no “copyleft”.

See the From P4 to P5 page, and the From P5 to P6 page for the derivation of these sources. In the readme.txt file for the P4 distribution, the author says, “As far as I know, pcom.pas and pint.pas have been released without restriction of use.” That is a little vague, but it means that there is unlikely to be any “implied copyright”, i.e., that the compiler and interpreter sources are in the Public Domain. (A few miscellaneous source files are distributed under an MIT license, but they have not been carried over to P5 or P6.) In Scott Moore's readme.txt file for the P5 distribution, he states, “Included here is the Pascal source of a public-domain Pascal compiler and interpreter, the P5 compiler and interpreter.” That explicitly places his P5 version in the Public Domain.

I developed the P6 sources by modifying the P5 sources, and like Scott Moore before me, I am donating them back to the Public Domain. I, Richard Sprague, the “Affirmer”, hereby waive all rights to the P6 sources (the “Work”) under the Copyright Laws, and rely on the CC0 statement, with four amendments and stipulations, below. If you want to modify them and take your version “private” for commercial purposes, you may do that; you don't legally owe me anything. I regard the P6 sources as payment for value received from a) the designer and original author, Prof. Niklaus Wirth, b) his students and associates who developed and distributed the various P-system releases, c) Scott Moore, the author of the P5 sources, and d) all others who ported Pascal to various target architectures, worked on standardization, or have otherwise added to Pascal's popularity since 1970.

There are no legal restrictions on the use of the P6 sources. There is no copyright and there is no “copyleft”. The decision to NOT distribute via a “copyleft” license is deliberate. The rationale (for those interested) is provided in this essay.

More formally (for the legal beagles out there), here is a copy of the “CC0”, the Creative Commons Zero document (distributed under the GNU Documentation License), in Courier New font, which is the basis of my waiver above, followed by my elaborations, amendments, and stipulations (in this font) to that document:

          Statement of Purpose

          The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically
          confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the
          creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an
          original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

          Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
          for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
          scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
          fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate
          in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any
          form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
          commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to
          promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
          creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
          greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
          efforts of others.

          For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
          expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
          associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
          she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
          voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
          the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
          Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
          of CC0 on those rights.

          1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may
          be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights
          ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
          include, but are not limited to, the following:

          the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
          communicate, and translate a Work; moral rights retained by the
          original author(s) and/or performer(s); publicity and privacy
          rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a
          Work; rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a
          Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; rights
          protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
          a Work; database rights (such as those arising under Directive
          96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
          1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
          implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
          of such directive); and other similar, equivalent or corresponding
          rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
          any national implementations thereof.

          2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
          contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
          permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
          surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
          associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown
          (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
          the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
          duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
          extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
          of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
          limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
          "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of
          the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
          successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
          revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal
          or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the
          public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

          3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
          reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
          then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
          taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
          addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants
          to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
          sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
          exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
          all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
          applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
          any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
          for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
          advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
          be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
          Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
          invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
          or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
          and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
          exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
          the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
          with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
          express Statement of Purpose.

          4. Limitations and Disclaimers. No trademark or patent rights held by
          Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise
          affected by this document. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes
          no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work,
          express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without
          limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
          particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
          other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors,
          whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent
          permissible under applicable law. Affirmer disclaims
          responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply
          to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
          person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further,
          Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
          consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
          Work. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons
          is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with
          respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
        

[End of CC0.]

   1. At the risk of invalidating this whole thing, I must point out that the phrase “without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation” is incorrect in the case of the Affirmer's waiver. I (the Affirmer) do expect “additional consideration or compensation”, as explained in the Copyleft essay. Any such consideration or compensation will not be gained by reliance upon any legal obligation, but by reliance on voluntary market forces and new folkways.

   2. In regard to item 4. above, "Limitations and Disclaimers", the Affirmer, Richard Sprague, stipulates that he holds no trademark or patent rights in the Work, and believes that there are none held by any other persons.

   3. The Affirmer also believes that the earlier source (Pascal P5) from which this Work was derived was validly placed in the Public Domain by the earlier author (Scott A. Moore), so that there is no need to obtain any “consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.”

   4. The Work cited above is the programming language code and comments in the five files pcom.pas, pint.pas, manual.html, p4-p5.html and p5-p6.html. Please note that the other documents accompanying the Work (web pages,downloaded HTML and .txt files, etc.) are NOT being placed in the Public Domain. The Affirmer is not waiving his copyrights to the text in the documents accompanying the Work. But permission is hereby granted to distribute them only as part of the original unmodified p6.zip file.
